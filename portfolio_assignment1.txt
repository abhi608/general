You roll a die until all six numbers have come up at least once. What is the expected value of the number of rolls?
A and B play a game. A rolls first and wins if she gets a 1. If not, B rolls and wins if he gets a 6. If not, the roll reverts to A. The players continue rolling until A or B wins, A by rolling a 1, B by rolling a 6. What is the probability that A will win?

A die will be rolled to determine the percentage interest rate, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% or 6%; and that rate will be applied to $1,000 to be received in 10 years. What is the expected present value of that cash flow?

Find values for a and b that minimize the sum of the squares of the horizontal distance of the points (1,1), (2,3) and (3,4) from the line X=a+bY
A standard six-sided die will be rolled and pay 4x dollars, where x is the result of the die. What is the utility in dollars of the payout to someone whose utility function is 1 - e-p/1,000, where p is payout?
What utility function of the form 1 - e-p/n gives the same value as square root utility, $441?
A stock will pay a dividend of $1 next quarter, growing at 2% per quarter for ten years, after which the dividend will stay constant forever. What is the present value of this stock at a 2.5% discount rate?
What are the partial derivatives of the stock price with respect to growth rate and discount rate?
Stock A has an expected return of 15% per year, and a standard deviation of return of 30%. Stock B has an expected return of 13% per year and a standard deviation of 40%.  The returns of stocks A and B are uncorrelated. What portfolio weighting of stocks A and B has the maximum ratio of expected return to standard deviation? That is, out of a $100 investment, you put $X into stock A, and $100 – $X into stock B in order to get the maximum ratio of expected return to standard deviation of return for the portfolio.
A stock sells for p0 = $100 today and will be either pup = $110 or pdown = $90 tomorrow. What is the value of a put option to sell the stock at a price of S = $105?
Write the formula for a call option value with strike price S in terms of p0, pup and pdown.
Compute the derivatives of the call value with respect to S, p0, pup and pdown.
A stock either goes up 20% or down 18% every trading day, with equal probability and daily moves are independent. What is the probability that the stock has a positive return after ten years (2,600 trading days)?

What is the expected value of the stock in ten years conditional it having a negative return?
